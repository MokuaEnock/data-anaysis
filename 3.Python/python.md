# Introduction

Python is a powerful, high-level, general-purpose programming language. It is a popular language for beginners because of its simplicity and readability, as well as its support for a wide range of applications.

## Key features of Python

Some key features of Python include:

1. **Dynamically-Typed** - Python is a dynamically-typed language, which means that you don't need to specify the type of a variable when you declare it. The interpreter will determine the type of the variable based on the value that you assign to it.
2. **Object-Oriented** - Python is an object-oriented language, which means that it supports encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. This allows you to create complex programs using a modular approach.
3. **High-Level** -Python is a high-level language, which means that it abstracts away many of the low-level details of computer systems. This makes it easier to write and understand code, but it can also make Python programs slower than equivalent programs written in a lower-level language.
4. **Interpreted** - Python is an interpreted language, which means that it is not compiled to machine code before it is executed. Instead, the interpreter reads and executes the source code directly. This makes it easy to develop and debug Python programs, but it also means that Python programs can run slower than compiled programs.

Python is a popular language for data science, data analysis and machine learnign because it has a large and active community of users and developers, a wealth of powerful libraries and frameworks for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization, and strong support for integration with other tools and systems.

- **NumPy** A library for efficient manipulation and analysis of large, multi-dimensional arrays of numerical data.

- **Pandas** A library for working with tabular data, including functions for reading and writing data to and from various file formats, cleaning and preparing data for analysis, and manipulating and transforming data.

- **Matplotlib** A library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations of data.

- **Seaborn** A library built on top of Matplotlib that provides additional functions for creating more sophisticated and attractive visualizations.

- **Scikit-learn** A library for machine learning that provides a wide range of algorithms and tools for tasks such as classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction.

- **TensorFlow** An open-source software library for machine learning and deep learning developed by Google.

Before we dive into these libraries we will have to go though the python basics you can follow this lesson in the notebook accompanying this markdown file.
