# Introduction

Data analytics is the process of analyzing and interpreting large sets of data to discover patterns, trends, and relationships. It involves using tools and techniques from statistics, computer science, and business to extract useful insights from data.

Data analytics can be used in a variety of fields, including business, finance, marketing, and healthcare. It can help organizations make better decisions by providing them with a deeper understanding of their data and the trends and patterns it contains.

There are several types of data analytics, including descriptive analytics, which involves summarizing data to understand what has happened in the past; diagnostic analytics, which involves identifying the root cause of a problem or issue; predictive analytics, which involves using data to make predictions; and prescriptive analytics, which involves using data to recommend actions to be taken.
